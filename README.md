# Grocery-Cost-Calculator
- A simple c++ program that takes daily consumed items with their price from users and produces a variety of results including the monthly cost of each items in a file or/and console.

## Features

- The items you write will be saved in a file, so you can add items to exiting file.
- The cost of each item will differ with each month since each month has different amount of days, so the monthly cost will be saved in a different file.
- The program takes in to account of leap years( since february can be either 28 or 29 depending on the year).
- Users can also view monthly or yearly cost of each item and the total monthly or yearly cost in the console. 
- There is also a feature for users to perform basic arithmetic operations(+, -, *, /, %) and a few basic operations(square root, square, cube).
